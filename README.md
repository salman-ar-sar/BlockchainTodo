# BlockchainTodo

Hello there! This is a todo list application made with Solidity and truffle.js.
This was done with the help of the tutorial by DAppUniverstiy on freeCodeCamp.org YouTube Channel (credits given below).

How to run it:
1. Install Ganache.
2. Add MetaMask add-on in your browser.
3. Run npm install in the project file directory
4. Run the command npm run dev. Then will open a new window in your browser.
5. In Ganache, take the private key of the first address and add it to MetaMask.
6. In MetaMask you have to add a new connection. The URP URL will be in Ganache.
7. Finally, you can add and complete a task using a blockchain application.
